Welcome! (or "☡ Guile ∘ PostgreSQL ∞")
======================================

	Guile-PG is a collection of modules for Guile allowing access to
	the PostgreSQL RDBMS from Scheme programs.

	The low-level module ‘(database postgres)’ provides an almost
	one-to-one correspondence with the PostgreSQL "libpq" C library
	interface.  The other modules build on it to provide abstractions
	and convenience procedures:

	  (database postgres-qcons)     -- Query Construction
	  (database postgres-resdisp)   -- Displaying Results
	  (database postgres-types)     -- Types Conversion
	  (database postgres-col-defs)  -- Column Definitions
	  (database postgres-resx)      -- Result Transforms
	  (database postgres-table)     -- Single-Table Abstraction
	  (database postgres-meta)      -- Introspection
	  (database postgres-gxrepl)    -- Easy Interaction

	This is alpha code (pre 1.0 release), tested with various, but
	not all, versions of Guile and PostgreSQL.  It may have bugs,
	and the interfaces may change from version to version.

	To build Guile-PG you need to have installed both the PostgreSQL
	frontend library libpq, and a version of Guile that can either
	load binary module (a b c) from file a/b/c.so or a/b/c/libc.la
	under ‘%load-path’, or provide ‘dynamic-link’ and ‘dynamic-call’.


Building and Installing Guile-PG
================================

	Generic install instructions are provided in the file INSTALL.
	If you're in a hurry:

	  ./configure [options]
	  make
	  make check
	  make install
	  make installcheck

	Each of the above steps is explained in detail below.


Configuration
-------------

	Normally, the configure script looks in $prefix/include and
	$prefix/lib for PostgreSQL headers and libraries, under the
	assumption that everything (Guile-PG, Guile and PostgreSQL)
	is to be installed there.

	If the ./configure script failed because it couldn't find
	libpq or the libpq headers then you can use the ‘PQ_CPPFLAGS’
	and ‘PQ_LDFLAGS’ vars to direct configure to the appropriate
	directory.  For example, if you installed PostgreSQL with the
	prefix $HOME/local, then you would invoke configure like so:

           ./configure                          \
	      PQ_CPPFLAGS=-I$HOME/local/include \
	      PQ_LDFLAGS=-L$HOME/local/lib

	If the configure script failed because it couldn't find
	guile-config, then make sure that script is on your path.

	If libguile is installed in a "non-standard" place, you may need
	to set the LDFLAGS environment variable to get configure to find
	it.  For example, if you use GCC with GNU ld and guile is
	installed under /opt/guile, then this can be achieved with the
	value: '-Wl,-rpath -Wl/opt/guile/lib' (quotes to protect spaces
	from the shell).

	If your platform needs "-R DIR" for the libpq link command, you
	can try the experimental configure option --enable-pq-rpath, or
	alternatively set the LDFLAGS env var as described above.

	After configuration, type:

	    make

	to build the libraries.


Testing
-------

	If configuration and "make" are successful, you can now run the
	tests.  To run the tests type:

            make check [DEBUG=1] [KEEPD=1] [INITDB=/path/to/initdb]

	This creates a temporary installation dir test/fake-install/,
	creates a cluster test/fake-cluster/, kicks the daemon, runs the
	tests, and kills the daemon afterwards.

	Cluster creation uses initdb(1) to do the work.  If that program
	is not in ‘PATH’, you need to specify it.  (Kicking the daemon
	uses pg_ctl(1) and psql(1) from the ‘PGPATH’ var output by
	‘initdb --show’, so there is no need to specify those directly.)

	The basic tests should all pass.  The large-object tests might
	fail because of bugs in PostgreSQL.  The abstraction tests are
	not supposed to fail, but you never know.  If a test fails, the
	daemon might persist; to kill it "manually", use command:

           cd test/ && make kill-daemon [INITDB=/path/to/initdb]

	Note that you may need to specify INITDB here, as well.
	In any case, the cluster persists, which reduces startup time
	for subsequent "make check" invocations (if you are in the mood).
	Use "make clean" to remove it and test/fake-install/ as well.

	The DEBUG=1 is optional.  If "make check" fails, please re-run
	it with DEBUG=1 and see "Reporting Bugs" below.

	Likewise, ‘KEEPD=1’ is optional.  If specified, the daemon is
	not killed, reducing startup time for subsequent runs.


What Goes Where
---------------

	If the basic tests passed then you may want to install Guile-PG.
	To do this type "make install", which puts files in these dirs:

	    modules         -- ${GUILE_LIBSITE}/database
	    guile-pg.info   -- ${infodir}

	The ${GUILE_LIBSITE} and ${infodir} values are determined by the
	configure script.  Typically, these would be, respectively,
	/usr/local/lib/guile/site and /usr/local/info.  Note that
	${GUILE_LIBSITE} is based on the ${prefix} used for installing
	Guile, and may or may not coincide with the one specified by
	‘configure --prefix’.

	Additionally, if the system supports it, "make install" updates
	each site dir's module catalog.

	After installation, you may wish to "make installcheck", which
	is essentially "make check" modified to look for the modules in
	the install tree instead of the build tree.  Use ‘DEBUG=1’ and
	look for ";;; loading" lines to verify proper operation.


Reporting Bugs
==============

	Please send bug reports to the address shown by running command:

	    ./configure --help

	Include Guile-PG version, the output of the show-platform script,
	and the log file of the test that failed (all in subdir "test").

	There is one known bug we can't do anything about (we tried but
	failed): The sourceforge folks don't want to update their site
	to point to the new Guile-PG homepage:

	    http://www.nongnu.org/guile-pg/

	But if there are enough links to the new page, perhaps the
	relevancy of sourceforge's obstinance will decline over time.
